# This example demonstrates the capabilities of Google's advanced Gemini models
# Each step showcases different model strengths and use cases

step_one:
  input:
    - examples/document-processing/sample.pdf
  model:
    - gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05  # Pro model for complex document analysis
  action: |
    Analyze this document and create a detailed summary focusing on:
    1. Key arguments and their supporting evidence
    2. Main conclusions
    3. Any gaps in the reasoning or areas that need more support
  output:
    - analysis.txt

step_two:
  input:
    - analysis.txt
  model:
    - gemini-2.0-flash-001  # Fast, efficient model for focused tasks
  action: |
    Create a bullet-point list of actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
    Focus on practical, implementable steps.
  output:
    - recommendations.txt

step_three:
  input:
    - recommendations.txt
  model:
    - gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21  # Specialized model for analytical thinking
  action: |
    For each recommendation:
    1. Evaluate potential challenges in implementation
    2. Suggest mitigation strategies
    3. Estimate resource requirements (time, cost, personnel)
  output:
    - implementation_plan.txt

step_four:
  input:
    - implementation_plan.txt
  model:
    - gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05  # Lightweight model for quick summaries
  action: |
    Create a concise executive summary (max 250 words) that highlights:
    - Top 3 recommendations
    - Expected impact
    - Critical success factors
  output:
    - executive_summary.txt
