# Batch Processing Example
# This example demonstrates how to use the new batch processing options
# for safely handling multiple files, especially when some files might have encoding issues

# Process multiple files individually (safer approach)
process-files-individually:
  input: 
    - "examples/*.txt"  # Process all text files in the examples directory
  model: "gpt-4o"
  action: "Summarize the content of each file."
  output: "STDOUT"
  batch_mode: "individual"  # Process each file individually (safer than "combined")
  skip_errors: true  # Continue processing even if some files fail

# Process multiple files combined (original approach)
process-files-combined:
  input:
    - "examples/file-processing/*.txt"
  model: "gpt-4o"
  action: "Analyze the combined content of all files."
  output: "STDOUT"
  batch_mode: "combined"  # Combine all files into a single prompt (less safe)
