**Ode to the Network Cables**

Beneath the hum of modern life they lie,  
In tangled paths where data lights entwine.  
Silent, they weave the streams that never die,  
Connecting souls through every thin design.  

Ether's veins that pulse with binary,  
Transmitting thoughts across the vast expanse.  
Invisible, yet holding every key,  
To dreams conveyed within the wired dance.  

Their colors bright, a spectrum intertwined,  
Each strand a lifeline in the digital,  
Ensuring bonds remain both firm and kind,  
A silent force that keeps our worlds in sync.  

O network cables, arteries unseen,  
You bind the realm where human hearts convene.
