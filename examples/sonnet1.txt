In silent coils beneath the floor they lie,  
A web of copper veins hidden from sight.  
Through plastic sheath their pulses swiftly fly,  
Delivering our data day and night.

Twisted pairs entwined in tight embrace,  
Shielding whispers flowing fast and true.  
Signals racing, coursing place to place,  
Connecting worlds and binding me to you.

Yet humble cables garner little praise,  
Their quiet labored lives remain unseen.  
But through their veins the modern world conveys  
The dreams of millions, bright upon the screen.

Respect the humble cable's silent art,  
For through its threads we touch from heart to heart.
