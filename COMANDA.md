# Project Memory

This file serves as persistent memory for AI-powered workflows. It stores context, patterns, and key insights that can be referenced across executions.

## Current Focus

Exploring AI workflow automation and learning how to effectively use memory-based context.

## Key Learnings

- Memory persistence helps maintain context across multiple workflow runs
- Structured sections make it easier to update specific parts of knowledge
- Combining memory with multi-step workflows creates powerful automation patterns

## Project Status

Status: Experimenting with memory-augmented workflows
