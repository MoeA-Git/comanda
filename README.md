# COMandA (Chain of Models and Actions)

COMandA is a command-line tool that enables the composition of Large Language Model (LLM) operations using a YAML-based Domain Specific Language (DSL). It simplifies the process of creating and managing chains of LLM activities that operate on files and information.

## Features

- üîó Chain multiple LLM operations together using simple YAML configuration
- ü§ñ Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- üìÑ File-based operations and transformations
- üñºÔ∏è Support for image analysis with vision models (screenshots and common image formats)
- üõ†Ô∏è Extensible DSL for defining complex workflows
- ‚ö° Efficient processing of LLM chains

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kris-hansen/comanda@latest
```

Or clone and build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kris-hansen/comanda.git
cd comanda
go build
```

## Configuration

### Environment File

COMandA uses an environment file to store provider configurations and API keys. By default, it looks for a `.env` file in the current directory. You can specify a custom path using the `COMANDA_ENV` environment variable:

```bash
# Use a specific env file
export COMANDA_ENV=/path/to/your/env/file
comanda process your-dsl-file.yaml

# Or specify it inline
COMANDA_ENV=/path/to/your/env/file comanda process your-dsl-file.yaml
```

### Provider Configuration

Configure your providers and models using the interactive configuration command:

```bash
comanda configure
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select a provider (OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama)
2. Enter API key (for OpenAI/Anthropic)
3. Specify model name
4. Select model mode:
   - text: For text-only operations
   - vision: For image analysis capabilities
   - multi: For both text and image operations

You can view your current configuration using:

```bash
comanda configure --list                       
Configuration from .env:

Configured Providers:

ollama:
  - codellama (local)
  - llama3.2 (local)
  - phi3.5 (local)

openai:
  - gpt-4o-mini (external)
    Mode: multi

anthropic:
  - claude-3-opus (external)
  - claude-3-sonnet (external)
  - claude-3-5-haiku (external)
```

To remove a model from the configuration:

```bash
comanda configure --remove <model-name>
```

When configuring a model that already exists, you'll be prompted to update its mode. This allows you to change a model's capabilities without removing and re-adding it.

Example configuration output:
```yaml
providers:
  openai:
    api_key: sk-...
    models:
      - name: gpt-4
        type: external
        mode: text
      - name: gpt-4o
        type: external
        mode: vision
  anthropic:
    api_key: sk-...
    models:
      - name: claude-2
        type: external
        mode: text
  ollama:
    models:
      - name: llama2
        type: local
        mode: text
```

## Usage

### Supported File Types

COMandA supports various file types for input:

- Text files: `.txt`, `.md`, `.yml`, `.yaml`
- Image files: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`
- Special inputs: `screenshot` (captures current screen)

When using vision-capable models (like gpt-4o), you can analyze both images and screenshots alongside text content.

Images are automatically optimized for processing:
- Large images are automatically resized to a maximum dimension of 1024px while preserving aspect ratio
- PNG compression is applied to reduce token usage while maintaining quality
- These optimizations help prevent rate limit errors and ensure efficient processing

The screenshot feature allows you to capture the current screen state for analysis. When you specify `screenshot` as the input in your DSL file, COMandA will automatically capture the entire screen and pass it to the specified model for analysis. This is particularly useful for UI analysis, bug reports, or any scenario where you need to analyze the current screen state.

### Creating DSL Files

Create a YAML file defining your chain of operations:

```yaml
# example.yaml
steps:
  - name: "Summarize Content"
    model: "gpt-4"
    provider: "openai"
    input: 
      file: "input.txt"
    prompt: "Summarize the following content:"
    output:
      file: "summary.txt"

  - name: "Generate Analysis"
    model: "claude-2"
    provider: "anthropic"
    input:
      file: "summary.txt"
    prompt: "Analyze the key points in this summary:"
    output:
      file: "analysis.txt"
```

For image analysis:

```yaml
# image-analysis.yaml
input: "image.png"  # Can be any supported image format
model: "gpt-4o"
action: "Analyze this image and describe what you see in detail."
output: "STDOUT"
```

The `examples/` directory in the project contains various sample DSL files demonstrating different features:
- `openai-example-dsl.yaml`: Basic OpenAI model usage
- `ollama-example.yaml`: Local model usage with Ollama
- `image-example.dsl.yaml`: Image analysis configuration
- `screenshot-example-dsl.yaml`: Screenshot capture and analysis

### Running Commands

Run your DSL file:

```bash
comanda process your-dsl-file.yaml
```

For example:

```bash
./comanda process example-dsl.yaml

Processing DSL file: example-dsl.yaml

Response from gpt-4o-mini:
Based on the company names provided, the following seem more like startups, often characterized by modern, innovative, and tech-oriented names:

1. Quantum Computing Labs
2. Blue Ocean Ventures
3. CloudNine Solutions
[...]

Configuration:
- Model: [gpt-4o-mini]
- Action: [look through these company names and identify which ones seem like startups]
- Output: [STDOUT]
```
